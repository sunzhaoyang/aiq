## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

#### Option 1: One-Click Install (Recommended)

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunzhaoyang/aiq/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Download and run install.bat
# Or run in PowerShell:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunzhaoyang/aiq/main/scripts/install.bat" -OutFile "install.bat"
.\install.bat
```

The installation script will:
- Automatically detect the latest version from GitHub Releases
- Detect your system architecture (darwin-amd64, darwin-arm64, linux-amd64, linux-arm64, windows-amd64)
- Download the binary to `~/.aiq/bin` (Unix/Linux/macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\.aiq\bin` (Windows)
- Print PATH command for you to add manually
- Verify the installation

**After installation, add to PATH:**

**Unix/Linux/macOS (zsh):**
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.aiq/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Unix/Linux/macOS (bash):**
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.aiq/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
setx PATH "%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\.aiq\bin"
```
(Then open a new terminal window)

#### Option 2: Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/sunzhaoyang/aiq.git
cd aiq
go build -o aiq cmd/aiq/main.go

# Install (optional)
sudo mv aiq /usr/local/bin/
```

### First Run

1. **Start AIQ**: `aiq`
2. **Configure LLM**: Enter API URL, API Key, and model name (wizard runs on first launch)
3. **Add Data Source**: Select `source` → `add` → Enter database connection details
4. **Start Querying**: Select `chat` → Choose data source → Ask questions in natural language

**Example queries:**
```
aiq> Show total sales for the last week
aiq> Count products by category
aiq> Show user registration trends
```

## 📚 Usage

### Main Menu

```
AIQ - Main Menu
? config   - Manage LLM configuration
  source   - Manage database connections
  chat     - Query database with natural language
  exit     - Exit application
```

### Chat Mode

AIQ supports two modes:

**Database Mode** (with source selected):
- Full SQL query capabilities
- Database schema context available
- Chart visualization support

**Free Mode** (no source selected):
- General conversation with AI
- Skills-based operations (execute_command, http_request, file_operations)
- No SQL execution (select a source to enable SQL queries)

**Multi-turn conversation:**
```
aiq[source-name]> Show total sales for last week
[Generated SQL and results...]

aiq[source-name]> Modify to show only last 3 days
[AIQ understands context and generates updated SQL...]
```

**Commands:**
- `/history` - View conversation history
- `/clear` - Clear conversation history
- `exit` or `back` - Exit chat mode (session auto-saved)

**Entering Free Mode:**
- When no sources are configured, AIQ automatically enters free mode
- When sources exist, select "Skip (free mode)" option in source selection menu

**Session restore:**
```bash
aiq -s ~/.aiq/sessions/session_20260126100000.json
```

### Chart Visualization

AIQ automatically detects suitable chart types based on query results:
- **Categorical + Numerical** → Bar chart or Pie chart
- **Temporal + Numerical** → Line chart
- **Numerical + Numerical** → Scatter plot

## 🎯 Skills - Extending AI Capabilities

Skills allow you to extend AIQ's capabilities by providing custom instructions and context to the AI agent. Skills are automatically matched and loaded based on your queries using **LLM-based semantic matching** for improved accuracy.

### Quick Start

1. **Create Skill directory:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.aiq/skills/my-skill
```

2. **Create SKILL.md file:**
```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Domain-specific guidance for metrics, dashboards, and SQL patterns
---

# My Custom Skill

This skill provides guidance for analytics workflows and common SQL patterns.

## Key Concepts

- Naming conventions for metrics and dimensions
- KPI calculation patterns and caveats
- Time-based aggregations and cohort analysis

## Usage Examples

### Weekly KPI Summary
```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at) AS week,
       COUNT(*) AS orders,
       SUM(amount) AS revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week;
```

3. **Restart AIQ** - Skills are loaded automatically on startup

4. **Use it** - When you query about topics matching your skill's description, it will be automatically loaded

### Skill File Format

Each Skill must have:

- **YAML Frontmatter** (required):
  - `name`: Skill name (lowercase, use hyphens, e.g., `my-skill`)
  - `description`: Skill description (max 200 chars, used for query matching)

- **Markdown content**: Instructions, examples, and guidance

### How It Works

1. **On Startup**: AIQ loads metadata (name, description) from all Skills in `~/.aiq/skills/`
2. **On Query**: System uses **LLM-based semantic matching** to find relevant Skills (falls back to keyword matching if LLM unavailable)
3. **Auto-Load**: Top 3 most relevant Skills are loaded into the prompt
4. **Dynamic Management**: System tracks Skills usage and evicts unused Skills during conversation
5. **Smart Compression**: System automatically manages prompt length using LLM semantic compression (preserves key context while reducing tokens)

### Matching Rules

Skills are matched using **LLM-based semantic understanding** for improved accuracy:
- **Semantic Matching**: LLM understands query intent and matches Skills based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Example**: "install mysql" matches installation Skills, not database documentation Skills (even if they mention MySQL)
- **Fallback**: If LLM matching fails, system falls back to keyword-based matching:
  - Exact name match (highest priority)
  - Partial name match
  - Description keyword match

### Dynamic Skills Management

During multi-turn conversations:
- **Usage Tracking**: System tracks when each Skill was last matched/used
- **Automatic Eviction**: Skills not matched in last 3 queries are evicted to free up tokens
- **Context Relevance**: Skills relevant to current conversation context are kept even if not matched in current query
- **Priority Management**: Active Skills (used recently) > Relevant Skills (matched) > Inactive Skills (not matched)

### Recommended Skills

- **[seekdb Skill](https://github.com/oceanbase/seekdb-ecology-plugins/blob/main/claudecode-plugin/skills/seekdb/SKILL.md)** - Documentation catalog and usage guidance for SeekDB

### Built-in Tools

Skills can use these built-in tools in their instructions:

- **`execute_sql`** - Execute SQL queries against the database
- **`http_request`** - Make HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **`execute_command`** - Execute shell commands (with security allowlist)
- **`file_operations`** - Read/write files (restricted to safe directories)

**Note**: Skills are context information, not tools themselves. They guide the AI on how to use the built-in tools.

### Prompt Management & LLM Compression

System automatically manages prompt length using **LLM-based semantic compression**:

- **80% threshold**: Start LLM compression (moderate compression, ~50% reduction)
  - LLM summarizes conversation history while preserving key decisions, results, and user preferences
  - Falls back to simple truncation if LLM compression fails
  
- **90% threshold**: Aggressive LLM compression (~70% reduction) + evict low-priority Skills
  - More aggressive summarization while maintaining essential context
  
- **95% threshold**: Maximum LLM compression (~80% reduction, keep only essential context)
  - Compresses both conversation history and Skills content
  - Keeps only active Skills and essential context

**Benefits of LLM Compression:**
- Preserves important context better than simple truncation
- Maintains conversation continuity
- Reduces token usage while keeping essential information
- Caches compression results to avoid re-compressing same content

### Directory Structure

Skills are stored in `~/.aiq/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`:

```
~/.aiq/
└── skills/
    ├── my-skill/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── data-analysis/
        └── SKILL.md
```

**Note**: Each Skill directory contains only one `SKILL.md` file. If you need multiple files, merge content into one file or split into multiple smaller Skills.

### Troubleshooting

**Skills not loaded:**
- Check directory structure: `~/.aiq/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Verify YAML frontmatter format (must start/end with `---`)
- Ensure `name` and `description` fields exist
- Check startup logs for errors

**Skills not matched:**
- Include relevant keywords in Skill `description`
- Try using Skill name in your query
- Check if multiple Skills are competing (only top 3 are selected)

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration files are stored in `~/.aiq/`:

- **config/config.yaml** - LLM configuration (URL, API Key, Model)
- **config/sources.yaml** - Database connection configurations
- **sessions/** - Conversation session files (auto-generated)
- **skills/** - Custom Skills (see Skills section above)
- **bin/** - Binary executable (installed via install script)

**Example config.yaml:**
```yaml
llm:
  url: https://api.openai.com/v1
  apiKey: sk-...
  model: gpt-4
```

**Example sources.yaml:**
```yaml
sources:
  - name: local-mysql
    type: MySQL
    host: localhost
    port: 3306
    database: testdb
    username: root
    password: password
```
